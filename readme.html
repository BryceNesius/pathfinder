General
========

For each of your team's implementations, explain the following (where appropriate and applicable):

- details on calling conventions, input and output data formats, limitations, bugs, and special features.
- negative aspects of your program (limitations, known bugs)
- positive aspects (extensions, special features)
- describe your choice of modularization (abstractions), data structures, and algorithms
- explain anything you did that is likely to be different from what other students may have done
- justify any design decisions for which the rationale isn't immediately clear

Feel free to modify the structure of this `readme.html` file to fit the current assignment and to fit how you wish to present your findings.


!!! note: Math Typesetting
    Surround your math with double dollar signs to have [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) typeset it beautifully.
    To add a tilde in math mode (using dollar signs), use the `\sim` command.
    If an exponent has more than one character, you must surround it with curly braces.
    In the example below, the exponent for $T$ must use curly braces, but they aren't required for $N$.

    $$ \sim T^{1.2} N^2 $$

    Note: Typesetting like this is optional; feel free to use plain text if you'd like.


Submission
-----------

Use the CSE LogHistory Plug-in to create a zip file containing all your code, this `readme.html` document, and any additional files of evidence (ex: screenshots).
If you create a zip by other means, it will include all the files under `tests` and might miss some important files (ex: `.log/history.log`).
The former will make for a very large zip file; the latter will cause you to lose points.

Assignment Details
===================


`Pathfinding` Implementation
---------------------------

<!--
Explain briefly how you implemented the Pathfinding data type.
What did you work on first?
What did you work on next?
-->
In order to implement this data structure, I utilized a minimum priority queue to keep track of Nodes added and always
return the Node with the lowest key. This implemented Dikstra's Algorithm with a little extra taking into consideration
a heuristic value that allowed the search algorithm to choose options that are in the direction of the end Node.
The actual logic of this was not particularly difficult, there is a main function where the bulk of the computation takes
place named computePath(). This is a basic while loop that loops until a path is found from "start" to "end". It contains
4 main if statements that check the neighboring tiles on a 2x2 integer array. If a neighbor has not been checked, a new
Node is created and on a secondary data structure which is a 2D boolean array will set the value of a checked tile to 'true'.
In order to calculate when to create a new PFNode on any given neighboring tile, the 4 main if statements check if the
anticipated new PFNode's coordinates are on the board or in bounds, and then also checks the secondary boolean 2D array
for if a PFNode has already been created for a particular tile. Then using a stack after finding the shortest path to the
'end', I push on all the coordinates for each node tracing the 'end' node all the way back to the 'start' node using an
iterator and adding all the coordinates along the path tracing the previous PFNodes and adding their coordinates to the
stack. This is then passed to the walker class in order to determine the solution path the Walker visualizer will use to
'walk' along the shortest path.


`PFNode` Implementation
------------------------

<!--
Briefly explain how you represented the search node PFNode.
-->
My PFNode implementation includes a few constructor variables to be stored in each Node, including, what PFNode the current
one came from and the Coordinates for a particular PFNode. This allows me to keep track of the shortest path via tracing
the current PFNode back to the 'start' PFNode. Each PFNode also stores the cost value it took in order to reach that
particular Node, which is calculated in a PFNode method called getCost(). This method utilized Dikstra's Algorithm and
a heuristic value to calculate the cost to reach any given PFNode along the shortest path to reach the end. The heuristic
value adds weight to the algorithm to choose a PFNode that is moving in the direction of the 'end' Node. The higher the
heuristic value the more directly the algorithm will try to reach the 'end'.


`Walker` Implementation
------------------------

<!--
Explain briefly how you implemented the Walker data type.
-->
The Walker implementation is quite simple, it takes in values determined in the Pathfinder class and uses the stack of
coordinates passed in to know which locations the walker should 'walk' along to reach the 'end' in the shortest path. The
speed of the walker is determined by whether or not there is a change in elevation or cost to travel from one PFNode to
another. It checks if there is a next() coordinate in the stack and then uses each to find where to move to next.


Analysis
===========


Correctness
------------

<!--
How did you test the correctness of your algorithm?
-->
Testing the correctness of this algorithm was pretty difficult as in order to debug, most of the code had to run without
errors, which was not the case. So in order to test the correctness, my partner and I drew out the smallest test board which
was 32x32 or 1024 tiles. Including print statements for coordinates and also printing which tiles new PFNodes were being
created on, we drew out the logic our program was taking before breaking. We manually drew out almost half of the board
searched before concluding it was following the correct logic, examining each possible path and only returning the shortest
path. In order to test the path cost and area of the board searched, we were able to eyeball the percent searched and tell
pretty easily that it was not returning the correct value, as 2% of the board is pretty obviously not when almost the whole
board is colored in as 'searched'. To calculate the correct path cost, I traced and printed the costs of all previous PFNodes
to confirm they had values and then finally found a bug where each cost was not being added, but overwritten by the stack created
in computePath(). This was an easy fix, I just had to move the logic of the stack until after I was done with the last
PFNode so that it was not overwritten.



Runtime Analysis
-----------------

<!--
For each of the following maps and given the default starting and ending locations, give the estimated travel cost ($\text{cost}_0(E)$) and search size for different heuristic values ($h$).
-->

map      | h      | cost      | search
---------|--------|-----------|--------
maze32_0 |   0    |   251.0   | 940 (91%)
maze32_0 |   1    |  5380.07  | 833 (81%)
maze32_0 |   2    | 10,509.14 | 827 (80%)
maze32_0 |  128   | 656,771.6 | 824 (80%)
maze32_1 |   0    |   55.0    | 915 (89%)
maze32_1 |   16   | 17,806.4  | 779 (76%)
usa128   |   0    |  1.747E7  | 10036 (61%)
usa128   | 0.0039 |  1.747E7  | 10036 (61%)
usa128   |   2    |  1.752E7  | 9357 (57%)
usa128   |   16   |  1.788E7  | 9420 (57%)
usa256   |   0    |  1.998E7  | 41,977 (64%)
usa1024  |   0    |  1.551E7  | 536,893 (51%)
usa1024  |  0.25  |  1.535E7  | 519,166 (49%)

<!--
Given the information above, do you notice any patterns?
Is there a value of $h$ that seems to work best?
-->
The pattern I notice when playing with the values is that the lower percent-area searched normally means a higher cost,
and the heuristic that seemed to give the best results was a very low heuristic value close to zero. Once the heuristic
grows too large, the results grow worse or the same as when it is 0.


Known bugs / limitations
-------------------------

<!--
What bugs or limitations were troublesome?
What bugs or limitations still remain?
Are these bugs or limitations a problem in your implementation, algorithm, or something else?
How do you know that you did not miss a bug?
What additional tests did you run to ensure that your implementations are correct?
-->

<!-- ... -->
After many hours of debugging, almost every single bug encountered in this project were the silly typo or incorrect operator
kind of bugs. After far too long debugging and walking through the code and problem manually and not getting the expected
results or values, it was almost always a silly syntax error or lack of understanding how an object is compared versus the
things within it. In terms of limitations, I believe this implementation could be much more efficient. As it stands I improved
the runtime dramatically by changing the logic of my getCost() function from a recursive call to just accessing the value of
the previous PFNode. This changed the resulting runtime, even on the Terrains where the size is very large to be almost
instant versus having to wait for a bit for the program to finish running. So far that was the biggest factor to improving
the runtime in this project, but I am sure there are several more improvements to be made in order to fully implement an
extremely efficient project.



Reflection
===========


<!--
Did you use any of the CT Skills?
If so, which ones did you use, and how did you use them?
If not, explain what you did when you needed help.
Or, did you not need help?

- consulting an expert
- asking good questions
- edge cases
- similar problems / fewer variables
- developing subgoals
-->
I used a plethora of critical thinking skills to complete this assignment and move past bugs. Often times many of the questions
asked were "why is it doing this, when it should be doing this?" This led to plenty of manually debugging by hand and with the debugger in InteliJ.
One of the most useful resources was my partner, as we were able to bounce any and all questions we had on bugs off one another
and really dig deeper into some of the questions we had as to why some part of the code was behaving like it was. For example,
calculating the neighbors in computePath() was giving us many problems and after drawing it out together and monitoring the
behaviour of the program we were able to figure out that what we assumed where 'left, right, above, and below' tiles were
actually mislabelled, so we were treating them as if they were properly labelled, which led to many bugs and errors during compiling, such
as throwing IndexOutOfBoundsExceptions.

<!--
What did you do to monitor your progress and make sure you did not spend more time than necessary on this assignment?
-->


<!--
Describe whatever help (if any) that you received.
Don't include readings, lectures, but do include any help from people (including course staff, lab TAs, classmates, and friends)  and attribute them by name.
-->
The bulk of the help recieved on this project was by the TA's understanding the problem and setup of the starting API,
and mostly from Dr. Denning assisting me in asking the right questions in order to determine the root cause of many bugs and errors.

<!--
Describe any serious problems you encountered.
-->
Like I stated above, most of the bugs and errors for this project were silly typos or misunderstanding of what was being stored
in variables. The logic was rather simple and overall the project only looks extremely complex because of all the helper methods
and Class functions included.
